The meeting for each week is limited to 15 people on a first-come-first-serve basis (group calling from the same room counts as one participant on Zoom).\n\nThe Burst Chaser meeting group strives to create a space where everyone would feel welcome and safe to learn about the fascinating astronomy topics.\n\nTo help us achieve this goal, we ask everyone to follow the general guidelines listed below:\nFocus the discussion on science topics.\nBe respectful to others, especially those who have different opinions.\nAvoid using improper language. If you don’t think the language is proper for children to hear, do not say it during the meeting.\n\nWhile we follow the general guideline, we also recognize that the Burst Chaser group consists of members from all over the world with different cultural backgrounds.

Please see my two follow-up comments / responses and a final list of pre-beta ToDo items.\n\n**Follow-up Comments:**\n1. *Retirement* - We can set up Caesar to enable added complexity in retirement limits, but for beta testing lets keep things simple (and uniform) and use a single fixed limit. Also, OK to use default 15 classification limit for beta testing.\n2. *Pulse Shapes Hashtag Option* - My comment in the \"Task\" section = For object classes that aren't included as a button and rely on Talk, you should expect very few people to contribute / use the hashtags.  The simple reality: most volunteers don't click through to Talk or read the Field Guide to discover the rare class suggestions. If you accept that you won't receive many/any rare class tags, OK. If you want non-zero response rates for the rare classes, you should add additional answer choices on the T1 task -OR- add a \"rare class\" button on T1 and add an optional third question task (e.g., T2; only asked in case of \"rare class\" answer on T1) with rare class answer choices.\n\n**Pre-beta ToDo Items:**\n\nPractice Workflow\n- Enable “Hide classification summaries” to remove extra click at end of classification.\n- Add Per-task Task Help: single examples of each class as supplement to Field Guide\n\nPulse Shapes Workflow\n- Confirm Fixed Retirement Limit: \"Minimum 15 + 90% consistency, maximum 100\"\n- Make T0 \u0026 T1 required by ticking box above answer choices in Lab (must click at least one answer for each task).\n- Enable “Hide classification summaries” to remove extra click at end of classification.\n- Add Per-task Task Help: include one or a few marked examples as supplement to Field Guide\n","comment_focus_id":null,"comment_focus_type":null,"comment_user_id":63325,"comment_user_login":"lcjohnso","comment_created_at":"2023-10-17T17:19:44.639Z"},{"board_id":5849,"board_title":"Team + Zooniverse Private Board","board_description":"For communication between the Zooniverse and research team members","discussion_id":2919411,"discussion_title":"Internal Project Review","comment_id":5139860,"comment_body":"Hi Cliff @lcjohnso, \n\nThanks again for the helpful suggestions! \n\nI have revised the Burst Chaser page following your suggestions, which includes changing the setting to enable “Hide classification summaries”, make T0 and T1 required, and add the help text in additional to the field guide.\n\nI also confirmed that we will fix the Retirement Limit to \"Minimum 15 + 90% consistency, maximum 100\" for the beta testing. We (i.e., Carter, a UT student who is working on the Burst Chaser) have also developed a python script to check whether each burst passed the retirement criteria and we should be able to remove the retired sample once we go live.\n\nFor your comment #2, the rare class in the talk hashtag is indeed just for some rare classes and for advanced users who may be interested in identifying some more strange structures. It is okay if we don't get many users using those hashtags.\n\nI believe we are on track for the beta testing on Tuesday! Please let me know if you see anything else to change. \n\nThanks again!\nAmy","comment_focus_id":null,"comment_focus_type":null,"comment_user_id":2467997,"comment_user_login":"AmyLien","comment_created_at":"2023-10-20T18:02:52.371Z"},{"board_id":5849,"board_title":"Team + Zooniverse Private Board","board_description":"For communication between the Zooniverse and research team members","discussion_id":2919411,"discussion_title":"Internal Project Review","comment_id":5148023,"comment_body":"Hi @AmyLien -- Everything looks good, so I'll send your project out for beta testing today!

If you see data continuous and without signal breaks in the middle (shown as straight zigzagging lines connecting the signal), then the data is complete.\n\nThe blue area is just an algorithm guide for us to use to identify the spike more easily, but if there isn't one and we see a spike, then it should be okay to identify what you can.

I encourage you to take a look at two papers listed on our publications page that discuss some of the relevant aspects: [Eveleigh et al. 2013](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1412171/) and [Greenhill et al. 2014](https://pure.port.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/1790403/COXj_2014_cright_GO_Playing_with_science.pdf). But in short: leaderboards and competitive features can significantly change the incentives for individuals to participate and lead to demotivation and other negative aspects. As you mention, the submission of poor quality classifications to boost scores and leaderboard position is a known negative behavior that has occurred.\n\nInstead (as discussed a bit in Greenhill+14), we would recommend different \"gamised\" behaviors: using intermediate goals and \"classification challenges\" to motivate volunteers collectively. For example: linking subject sets as batches and setting a challenge for completion of the next batch. Also, individual recognition can still be used in useful ways: recognizing \"top N\" users, or setting a goal of X classifications per user and recognizing all those who surpass that threshold. But beware that not all volunteers consent to public notification or recognition of their work, so please proceed with caution and always ask for permission before posting about individuals.\n\nA small number of projects use leaderboards, and a greater number of projects find ways to recognize individuals in a variety of other ways (e.g., congratulating milestones via public mention in project email newsletter or privately via direct message on Talk).  For your project, I stress you proceed with care in the use of any technique you choose to use.","comment_focus_id":null,"comment_focus_type":null,"comment_user_id":63325,"comment_user_login":"lcjohnso","comment_created_at":"2023-11-01T16:41:59.854Z"},{"board_id":5849,"board_title":"Team + Zooniverse Private Board","board_description":"For communication between the Zooniverse and research team members","discussion_id":3150280,"discussion_title":"Adding in A Feature?","comment_id":5164051,"comment_body":"To see this one conversation on this topic from the perspective of volunteers themselves, see here: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/edh/rainfall-rescue/talk/3143/1334102?comment=2170690\u0026page=5","comment_focus_id":null,"comment_focus_type":null,"comment_user_id":63325,"comment_user_login":"lcjohnso","comment_created_at":"2023-11-01T16:42:50.963Z"},{"board_id":5849,"board_title":"Team + Zooniverse Private Board","board_description":"For communication between the Zooniverse and research team members","discussion_id":3142801,"discussion_title":"Beta Testing","comment_id":5164082,"comment_body":"Hi @AmyLien -- Just wanted to drop by to say that the feedback responses are looking great!

Sorry for the late reply. I was completely drowned in grading final exams last week. \n\nThe Burst Chaser is on track to launch on Jan 9 during the AAS Press Release. We will also present at the NASA Universe on Jan 11 during AAS. We are finishing the revision based on feedback from the Beta Test. All the revision should done in the next two weeks.\n\nSummary from the Beta Test:\n\n-\tWe revised the Field Guides to clarify some confusion. For example, we added descriptions about the blue regions in multiple places (the blue regions are selected by computer algorithms and the users should focus on those blue regions first).  We plan to add some small wording revision to the workflow questions to make this point clearer as well, since people may not read the Field Guides. \n\n-\tWe are working on implementing another optional workflow that have ~ a few dozen GRBs for people who would like more feedback about the pulse shapes. This workflow will have identical questions as the “Pulse Shape” workflow, but only for a small set of GRBs. Each GRB in this workflow will have specific feedback when users click on the options. Sebastian is working on finalizing the detailed feedback and Carter will upload the workflow soon (by ~ next week).\n\n-\tCarter developed codes that extract the Beta Testing results. We looked through those results and everything looks great. Both the Pulse Shape workflow and Where Are Pulses workflow give results that are consistent to what would be expected from a GRB astronomer.\n\n-\tI recently received some more feedback from the NASA Citizen Science Strategist, Sarah Kirn. I am currently revising some wordings in the Burst Chaser workflow and field guides to address her comments and make things clearer. I plan to finish this by next week.\n\n-\tCarter has finished the code to retire data that has pass specific retirement rules. We will run the code once a day after launch to perform the data retirement. Following Cliff’s suggestion, we will set a higher standard for retiring data to make sure we have enough classification before the subject is retired.\n\n-\tWe have translators to translate Burst Chaser to different languages. If the translations are done before the AAS meeting, we plan to include those languages.\n\nThanks again for your help!\n\nBest,\nAmy\n","comment_focus_id":null,"comment_focus_type":null,"comment_user_id":2467997,"comment_user_login":"AmyLien","comment_created_at":"2023-12-19T21:50:59.707Z"},{"board_id":5849,"board_title":"Team + Zooniverse Private Board","board_description":"For communication between the Zooniverse and research team members","discussion_id":3195400,"discussion_title":"Launch Prep","comment_id":5255003,"comment_body":"@lcjohnso,\n\nDo you know the link to the Burst Chaser page when it go live?

Thanks for the summary of final changes.  You appear on track for next week's launch (on Tue Jan 9), and glad to hear you've coordinated with NASA and AAS press folks.\n\nA few pre-launch ToDo items:\n1. Can you confirm timeline for having final workflows ready to go (and toggled to active) and subject sets linked to those workflows? I'd like to have everything in place by the end of this week (Fri Jan 5) if possible.\n2. Please re-read https://help.zooniverse.org/best-practices/2-launch-rush/ in preparation for your launch.\n3. Now is also the time to write your ‘launch’ e-newsletter text. You’ll share your draft text here (please tag me `@lcjohnso` in your post). Advice for good newsletter text is that it should be only one or two paragraphs, written in plain language, introducing the team and project, and asking for the public’s help. Here's a recent example of a good newsletter is: \n\n    \u003e Get your mask and snorkel ready: we're happy to announce the launch of OceanEYEs!\n\n    \u003e This new project asks volunteers to count and identify fish in underwater photos collected in the waters surrounding the Hawaiian Islands.  The project focuses on the “Deep 7” bottomfish, a group of seven species of fish that have both economic and cultural value to the islands.  The data from this survey are used in the Deep 7 stock assessment to provide managers with the best information to make management decisions, including annual commercial fishery catch limits.\n\n    \u003e The images are collected every year during the Bottomfish Fishery-Independent Survey in Hawaii (#BFISH) using state of the art stereo-camera systems. The camera systems, which rest on the seafloor for 15 minutes at a time, record hundreds of thousands of images over the course of the survey. That number of images can quickly overwhelm the project's small team of NOAA scientists, who are based out of the Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center.  Your contributions to the OceanEYEs project will help the research team analyze this valuable data and provide helpful training data for machine learning algorithms.\n\n    \u003e Get involved and give the project a try -- visit: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/benjamin-dot-richards/oceaneyes\n\n4.

Visit the following link\nhttps://www.zooniverse.org/projects/amylien/burst-chaser\nand help astronomers sort out the most powerful explosions in the universe! These mysterious and energetic events are called gamma-ray bursts. They are extremely bright and can be detected by space telescopes from billions of light years away. Astronomers think gamma-ray bursts are likely related to either supernovae, neutron stars, black holes, or even something that may be more exotic. \n\nIn Burst Chaser, you will see pictures of gamma-ray bursts detected by NASA’s Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory. Each picture records the pulse shape of a gamma-ray burst and encodes information of its physical origins. However, the pulse shapes are usually very complex and hard to decipher. It is also difficulty for computer to automatically sort out these pulses. Therefore, we need your help to classify these shapes and produce the first pulse-shape catalog. This will help astronomers understand the true nature of these mysterious bursts!\n\n-------\n\nThanks again for all your help!!!\n\nBest,\nAmy","comment_focus_id":null,"comment_focus_type":null,"comment_user_id":2467997,"comment_user_login":"AmyLien","comment_created_at":"2024-01-06T01:16:53.493Z"},{"board_id":5849,"board_title":"Team + Zooniverse Private Board","board_description":"For communication between the Zooniverse and research team members","discussion_id":3195400,"discussion_title":"Launch Prep","comment_id":5280405,"comment_body":"Hi @AmyLien -\n\nI’m excited to see everything ready to go!

For this one, the feedback suggest the answer is \"Other\", because there is a small pulse (at around 7 second) on top of the large pulse. However, if you pick the \"simple pulse\", it is also okay for this case. As you can see, some of the pulse shape are a bit ambiguous and this is one of the reasons we are gathering classifications from all of you to help us collect more statistics. \n\nAlso, for the pulse shape practice set, we ran into some constraints about posting the correct hit/miss respond when there are two or more correct answers.

If there is a case where multiple pulses have different descriptions, put both down and we will sort them out as one or the other later on! \n\nIn this case, this is considered multiple pulses that happened and wouldn't be classified as rapidly varying since there are around 20 seconds between the pulses. There can be an argument to be made for a few things here and that is up to your discretion so I will point them out and let me know what you think!\n\n1. Fast rise slow decay in the first pulse \n-Explanation: The rise is much faster than the fall and it takes a little longer for the pulse to go back to noise\n2. Pulses connected by extended emissions in the right active area\n- Explanation: In the rightmost area of the blue region, there are two pulses with an emission between them that causes the counts not to drop below zero so that would be two pulses connected by extended emissions. \n\nBetween the two areas of activity would be considered noise since the counts in the graph dip below the zero mark and go up and down around that line.  Extended emissions have to never dip below zero to count as extended emissions \n\nIf you agree with these, disagree, or want to add anything that might have confused you please let me know!

Welcome to Burst Chaser and I am excited to learn that you have worked on gamma-ray astronomy before. We are indeed happy that we have more gamma-ray detections nowadays. \n\nThese are really excellent and deep questions that you mentioned here. We actually got similar questions from professional astronomers all the time because this telescope adopts a rather different technology than typical astronomy telescopes. I will try to answer them here in a few paragraphs, but you may even want to check out the [Swift/BAT manual for astronomers](https://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/analysis/bat_swguide_v6_3.pdf}, as there are a lot of cool technical details involved.\n\n\u003e How is it that the pulse counts are fractional?\n\u003e Isn't a count a discrete event at the sensor, and therefore, the histogram is confined to an integer counting space?\n\nThe Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) uses a technique called the \"[Coded Aperture] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coded_aperture)\" to construct a gamma-ray image and localize gamma-ray bursts. Localizing gamma ray sources have always been very challenging because gamma rays are so energetic that it cannot be reflected/refracted and focused on an image plane.  Swift/BAT adopts the coded-aperture technique to use the shadow pattern from a detection mask, placed at around 1 m above the detector plane, to estimate where the gamma-ray burst comes from. \n\nTherefore, the counts you see in the figure are called mask-weighted count. It is the original counts (which are integers, as you'd expected) in each detector pixel multiplying by a mask-weighting number, which estimates the chance of a photon falling on this specific detector pixel from the location of this specific gamma-ray burst.  \n\nMoreover, to help astronomers comparing counts from each gamma-ray bursts more fairly, the final mask-weighted count are divided by the total number of active detectors, which changes from time-to-time and can vary from ~10000 to 30000 throughout the Swift mission lifetime. \n\nAlso, because of this mask-weighting process, you will also see negative counts. During those background regions (e.g., most of the white region in those figures), you should see these mask-weighted counts fluctuated around the zero line.\n\n\u003eHow many gamma rays constitute a count?\n\nBecause of all these complication in the reconstruction phase, there is no one single value that convert the original gamma-ray count to this mask-weighted count. It depends on the source location and many other factors (like the number of active detectors).\n\n\u003eCan the approximate wavelength of the gamma rays be depicted, or is it a threshold measurement only?\n\nYes, we can now measure wavelength (or the gamma-ray photon energy, which is the unit that are often used by gamma-ray astronomers) in pretty good precision. For example, Swift/BAT are sensitive to gamma-ray photons from around 15 to 150 keV, and has an energy resolution of a few keV.\n\nAnd it's a great suggestion to include more description about the motivation behind these questions. In short, these are questions that will help astronomers advanced the theoretical models of gamma-ray bursts, and also help astronomers better understand the confusion between short and long gamma-ray bursts. I will add more description about this either in the Research section or in the FAQ.\n\nThank you for your awesome questions!\n\n\n\n\n","comment_focus_id":null,"comment_focus_type":null,"comment_user_id":2467997,"comment_user_login":"AmyLien","comment_created_at":"2024-01-12T16:05:08.841Z"},{"board_id":5354,"board_title":"GRB Subject Notes","board_description":"Have questions about a GRB subject?

We love it when you all want clarification or want to bounce back ideas. Thank you for taking the time to learn about and help our project. \n\nHere is a note about the two structures that you wrote about in case you wanted some more clarification.\n\nPulses connected by underlying emissions\n-This is where you have two distinct peaks that aren't from noise and are connected with the blue line never going under the 0 counts bar, if it does for a single bin that seems out of place that's usually the only exception, otherwise, there is noise in between and then it wouldn't be that option. \n\nSymmetrical structures\n-This is more of a visual one that is hard to give a concrete rule set for. I go by the rule of thumb where if I can split it in the middle and it looks at least more than 85-90%~ the same or more flipped then it can be considered symmetrical. You might have an easy time seeing that with a single peak going straight up and down or some mountain-like structure that has about the same rise as it does fall and those are more up to the person classifying them!\n\nHope this helps, if you ever want help to double-check we have a field guide that gives some examples too as well as practice that might help if you ever feel less confident or need more insight at your disposal.

Usually, when I look at those towers by themselves I look at the surrounding noise area before and after the blue region and look to see if any peaks are of close height which I would deem the 40-second peaks close enough to that peak at -22 seconds to consider it all noise. \n\nIn terms of the blue region the pulses you see are right! anything with a very large peak or an extended period above the 0 count is what I would consider part of the burst or a peak. the left one is easily seen as a burst might be argued that it has a fast rise and slow decay and the second and third peaks have a larger difference than the noise and are above the zero counts for a longer time to be declared pulses.\n\nHopefully, this helps and makes some sense.

What you said about the elevated area above the zero counts is the really important thing here; that is a burst being detected.\n\nEven if there is a little difference between what is considered noise, the fact that the count is above zero for over 100 seconds indicates something did occur but nothing normal like the pulses normally seen.

Just a little note is that it does make sense following the data from the computer that there would be a pulse with extended emission but around 70 seconds to the 200-second mark it is hard to notice when it goes below the zero count line. The computer does a great job but it is not 100% accurate so if you think the emission is shorter than the indicated blue region please indicate so or if you even think it is longer that is fine but use your best judgement!\n\nHope this helps and thank you for helping with our project.

These are really good questions.\n\n\u003e Is it important to draw the top of each square near the peak if the data? Or, can the top of each square be drawn anywhere above the peak of the data?\n\nPlease draw it as close to the peak as possible, though you don't need to worry about being super precise, just do your best. We will be using the top of the square to have a rough measure of the height of the peak. This will tell astronomers how large each pulse is.\n\n\u003e Is it important to draw the beginning (left) and end (right) of a square really close to where it rises from (and returns to) the background noise?\n\nSimilar to the peak, please draw the box as close to the beginning and end of the pulse, which is where it rises from and returns to the background noise, as you mentioned here. We will use this information to tell astronomers when the pulse starts and ends, and how long each pulse is. \n\nBut again, just do your best, you don't need to be super precise. You can take a look at some examples in the \"Marking major pulse structures\" in the Field Guide to get a sense of how close you need to draw these box to the pulse.\n\n\u003e Is it important that square borders not overlap (when multiple squares are drawn)?\n\nYes. Please try to draw each box so that the borders do not overlaps. This is because we are using the edge of the square to tell us when the pulse starts and ends. \n\n\u003e Does the square top and bottom have to be within the plot area boundary/border?\n\nYes. The box/square top and bottom need to be within the plot area. More specifically, they need to be within the black border lines of the plot. If you draw the box/square as close to the pulse as possible, the square should hopefully be naturally within this border. The bottom part of the square can be less precise, since we can simply use the zero count line to tell the bottom part of the pulse.\n\nThanks again for your help and the great questions!

The difference in noise level are usually due to the telescope pointing at different directions in the sky. \n\nFor this burst, if you go to the BAT light curve page (in the \"i\" icon under the figure; https://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/results/batgrbcat//GRB080325/web/GRB080325.html#lc), and select \"with slew time\" on the left side of the light curves, you will see gray areas show up in the light curve plots. These gray areas indicate the time intervals when the space telescope was slewing (that is, when the telescope is moving from one direction to another).

I was basing my assessment on the \"A pulse followed by extended emission\" example in the Field Guide, but I agree the frequency of sub-zero points is uncomfortably high compared to that example.  Since you brought this up, can you clarify a couple of other points?  First a definition question.  In the instructional instructional materials, signals called underlying emission seem to lie between one or more pulses, while those termed extended emission follow a single peak or come at the end of a peak series.  Is that the correct use of the terminology, or should what I called underlying emission here be considered extended emission associated with the first group of pulses (if the negative readings had been lacking) even though a further pulse eventually occurred?  And second, are there any guidelines to define when multiple peaks should be marked as separate pulses vs a categized as multiple pulses within a large structure?  If I remember correctly, I considered this case a close call but ended up marking the entire region from about 0-50 s as a single structure.  I tend to define multiple pulses when the signal between pulses falls reasonably close to the baseline (perhaps ~10-15% of the peak heights) and the pulses are more clearly separated by gaps, but I struggle with exactly when to make such a distinction.

Those were the specifications that we were instructed to have, so even if there might be a pulse that follows along with that I think the wording says a pulse followed by extended emission inferring there should only be one pulse in the graph. \n\nAnd then following along with the second question that you were talking about with the pulse area of the first 50 seconds, that's part of the fun to me. We may have different ideas as to what that might be, I see just one pulse there that has a slow decay but because of the time scale issues and how it is hard to fully understand at a glance some may infer that as multiple pulses connected by underlying emissions. \n(If that was by itself and had no negative readings you could argue it is an extended emission)\n\nIf you see multiple pulses like that in the one structure try your best to identify each pulse you see, but if you don't feel like making 16 boxes or it is too aggravating to do everything like that, one big box is also fine. \n(Hey there again to answer the pulse parenthetical, you are more than welcome to think that! that is a good idea. sometimes if there is an outlier dip, it might just be the binning being weird when recording the data)\n\nIf you struggle to tell the difference or don't know how to classify it, you are more than welcome to put them in these forums and I will try to help eventually but also if you feel more confident than not, use that confidence and answer as best as you think! The more classifications you do the better you get at spotting these things too.

In general, astronomers think that gamma-ray bursts with pulses longer than around 2 seconds are related to supernovae (explosions of massive stars when they run out of fuel), and gamma-ray bursts with pulses shorter than 2 seconds are related to the merging of neutron stars and black holes. And the specific structures of those pulses tell us something about the properties of the jet from a gamma-ray burst, and how the jet interacts with the surrounding environment. \n\nAstronomers used to think that because there is less material around neutron stars and black holes when they merge, we are expected to see shorter duration of gamma-ray pulses. However, recently we have seen some examples of mergers related to long gamma-ray bursts, and supernovae associated with short gamma-ray bursts. These exceptions make the association between the pulses and their physical origins less clear, and this is exactly why we would like your help to further classify these pulse structures so we can have a better understanding of how to connect them with the physical origins of each gamma-ray burst.\n\nIn addition to the pulses, astronomers also often use another type of graph called \"spectrum\", which tells us the energy distribution of the photons emitted from these gamma-ray bursts. The spectrum also encodes further information of whether a gamma-ray burst is related to a supernova or a merger event.\n\nIf you'd like to learn more, there are some information in the Research page on Burst Chaser. There are also more detailed information listed in the FAQ, under the \"How does classifying light curves help astronomers probe the physical origins and emission mechanism of GRBs?\" question. \n\nI hope this answer (at least some of) your questions.

I agree with you that it is a bit hard to distinguish all those later pulses due to the noise level (and the changes in the noise levels due to spacecraft slews. as you mentioned). For the 3rd pulse at ~T+800s, I think it is likely due to some artificial effect as the burst location left the telescope's field of view (that is, after that time the telescope could no longer see the burst). From experiences, we frequently sees those artificial spikes right before the burst leaves the field of view. Therefore, in this case I also wouldn't count the peak at 800 s as a pulse.\n\nThank you for your help and leaving these very helpful note!\n\n","comment_focus_id":95374840,"comment_focus_type":"Subject","comment_user_id":2467997,"comment_user_login":"AmyLien","comment_created_at":"2024-01-22T00:34:49.787Z"},{"board_id":5354,"board_title":"GRB Subject Notes","board_description":"Have questions about a GRB subject?

There are some very weak emission from @ t - 150 s to the first pulse.

However, if you go to the BAT light curve page in the metadata (https://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/results/batgrbcat//GRB180720C/web/GRB180720C.html#lc), click the \"SN=5 or 10 s binning (full-time range)\" link, it will show you a light curve with large times.

I interpreted your comment above as specifying two small pulses, one from 0-35 seconds and the other from 40-100 seconds.  I see nothing but noise until about the 30 second point on the X axis.  Then I see two small pulses - one from about 30-60 seconds, and the second more complex one from about 60-110 seconds where the main pulse begins.  That would be consistent with your interpretation if the beginning of the blue area is considered to be the time origin.  So should we also be defining pulse positions based on the start of the blue area being 0 time, or do you actually see indications of a pulse from 0-35 seconds as defined on the X axis?  Thanks for the clarification.","comment_focus_id":95374186,"comment_focus_type":"Subject","comment_user_id":1580620,"comment_user_login":"jrchem","comment_created_at":"2024-01-23T15:24:32.200Z"},{"board_id":5354,"board_title":"GRB Subject Notes","board_description":"Have questions about a GRB subject?

This is a very good question, and we actually don't know the answer for sure, which is why we need your help on finding these kinds of events so we can learn more. \n\nAs @Dansky1 mentions, the precursor emissions may be related to some activities between the interaction between the two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole as they are merging. Or there may be some emission leading up to the main pulse from those jets related to a supernova.

It's great to learn that you have backgrounds in Aerospace Engineering and love exploring the universe. In Burst Chaser, You will see pictures of gamma-ray bursts, one of the most powerful explosions in the universe!\n\nTo start, please go to the [main page of the Burst Chaser](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/amylien/burst-chaser) and select a workflow. Please go to the Field Guide (a tab on the right side of the screen) for introduction of what a pulse is in these pictures, and the different pulse shapes that we'd need your help identify. \n\nIf you'd like some more guidance of how to distinguish pulse vs noise and different pulse structures, start with those optional workflows, which will give you some more feedback. Once you feel comfortable to start the tasks, go to either the \"Pulse Shapes\" workflow or the \"Where are pulses\" workflow. You can switch between different workflow as you pleased. Simply go back to the main page of the Burst Chaser to switch between workflow.\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to let us know.

I am new to this type of project but I have done a lot of categorization on other Zooniverse projects. I am retired and like to volunteer in the winter time.\nI was unable to find some information in the field guide and I am wondering if you can point me to/provide an answer regarding how to mark GRBs. Specifically, do we mark each pulse in the image we see with a rectangle or can we select multiple with one rectangle to include all (if there are multiple pulses in one image). Also, should the rectangle mark that we make start at 0 and be dragged just to the top of the pulse or is a \"rough\" rectangle mark showing where the pulse is good enough?

You only need to bracket the major pulse structures, and please ignore those rapidly-varying smaller pulses.

It's my pleasure to try tò solve . \nIn my point of view\nThe basic point should cosidered is that X-Rayss shouldn't be part of judgement and analysis  when the Alfa \u0026 Beta rays takes much more time to travel slowly compared with GRB ( photons) . Because they are consisted of masses ( electron , neutrons \u0026 protones ) which travel much more slower through space than Gamma rays ( photons ) . If we are studying near GRB its ok .

The algorithm is sometimes too literal in establishing the start of T100.  It waits until the rising edge of the pulse exceeds the average noise level, and misses the actual start of the pulse.  See https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/amylien/burst-chaser/talk/subjects/95374012 for an example (GRB140818B).  In this case, the blue region starts around time -4 s, when the pulse begins to rise above ambient noise, but to my eye, the pulse actually begins at the rise from the last negative excursion around time -5 sec.  In other bursts, the pulse might begin well above zero, at the top of a noise spike, and the algorithm calls it correctly.  Human vs machine perception I suppose, and I don't know how to code for that.   On the other hand, the algorithm is better than me at detecting an subtle extended rise of the baseline after a pulse. \n\n","comment_focus_id":null,"comment_focus_type":null,"comment_user_id":2693408,"comment_user_login":"MisterMike","comment_created_at":"2024-02-05T14:06:55.013Z"},{"board_id":5354,"board_title":"GRB Subject Notes","board_description":"Have questions about a GRB subject?

The algorithm adopted to determine T100 is a method called the Bayesian Blocks. \n\nBroadly speaking, the Bayesian Blocks method uses Bayesian statistics to determine blocks (intervals) in the light curve where the counts do not change significantly. And the algorithm reports the locations (i.e., times) for all these \"blocks\". The first block usually corresponds to the background before the burst happens (i.e., where the first significant change of the counts occur), and the last block corresponds to the background after the burst emission ends. The interval between the first and the last block is called T100. \n\nAs you observed, sometime the Bayesian Block algorithm does not correctly capture the start and end time of the burst. There could be many reasons for this, for example, a larger noise fluctuation, or some changes in the noise level. There are also parameters one can set for this algorithm, which will also change the locations and the number of blocks found by the algorithm. \n\nIn addition, our pipeline perform the Bayesian Block algorithm on light curves with different time bins, in order to capture weaker emissions.\n\nAs you noted, the algorithm usually does a pretty good job. However, there are definitely cases where it didn't do well and human does a much better job. We plan to use the inputs from all our volunteers to investigate whether we can train future computer algorithm to do a better job.\n\nIf you are interested to learn more about the Bayesian Block method. You can find more detailed description here: \nhttps://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/lheasoft/help/battblocks.html\nand the original paper that described the method here:\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/9711233.pdf\n\n(These documents are written for gamma-ray burst astronomers, so there may be some jargons.

Sorry for the delay in responding. \n\n Sometimes the algorithm is not entirely accurate, if a pulse is clearly two or more times larger than the background noise, I think that it would be good to mark them. I might not be correct about that as I didn't write the code, but I think it's quite alright to box a pulse outside the blue area, in fact I think it would be good to do so - if it's clearly a missed pulse. Maybe @SebastianReisch or @MurawskiC1 could answer better about the algorithm stability for that.\n\n On the particular example I would put the background as ~0.018 so doubling that would be 0.036 which the 22 second mark is close to that, but I would say it's not. It is very close to that so I might be wrong, but I think it should be a little clearer. The time at 30 seconds doesn't rise to 2X the noise, I think. They do look like something but are too close to the noise level for me.\nThanks for all the help @nathancbell !","comment_focus_id":95372894,"comment_focus_type":"Subject","comment_user_id":2153230,"comment_user_login":"Dansky1","comment_created_at":"2024-02-15T17:14:12.809Z"},{"board_id":5354,"board_title":"GRB Subject Notes","board_description":"Have questions about a GRB subject?

Several people reported this as well, so we added some clarification in the FAQ: Occasionally, you may see a plot that does not have any blue region, despite an obvious pulse shown in the plot. Those are usually because the pulse is too short so that the computer program failed to plot the blue region. In those case, please use your best judgement. (And these are examples that computers are not always right and we rely on you to help us!)\n\nHope this helps. Thanks again for working on the pulses!\n\nBest,\nAmy","comment_focus_id":95703142,"comment_focus_type":"Subject","comment_user_id":2467997,"comment_user_login":"AmyLien","comment_created_at":"2024-02-17T00:02:58.823Z"},{"board_id":5354,"board_title":"GRB Subject Notes","board_description":"Have questions about a GRB subject?

This is a great question, but we actually don't have a clear definition for rapidly varying pulses, which is one of the difficulty for computer algorithms to identify this. Generally, when you see sub-pulses that are much much shorter than the underlying main pulse, that's when we flag these as rapidly varying pulses. Please go with your best judgement.

And it's amazing that you spent time finding the additional info. \n\nI am the person wrote those spacial note on the BAT GRB page. As @Ineedspace found, this burst is a very famous one, so called the naked-eye burst, because it was so bright that you could see the optical counterpart with naked eyes! \n\nHere is a wiki page for this burst: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRB_080319B\n\nBecause the burst is extremely bright, it saturates the telescope detector, and we are missing a large chuck of data. Those smooth slopes you saw from ~ 60 s to ~ 120 s, and from ~300 s to  ~675 s are a result of the data gap. The plotting algorithm simply connect the two points before and after the data gap with a line.\n\nFor the spike right after the slew that @jrchem mentioned, I think it is real. Usually, we see those artifact spikes either right after the source came into the telescope's field of view, or right before the source left the field of view.  That is, you should see those artifact spikes close to the parts when the counts become precisely zero (this means the source can no longer be seen by the telescope). Here is an example: https://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/results/batgrbcat/GRB110212A/web/GRB110212A.html (see the weird noise happens around 630 s).","comment_focus_id":95373184,"comment_focus_type":"Subject","comment_user_id":2467997,"comment_user_login":"AmyLien","comment_created_at":"2024-03-08T00:53:50.855Z"},{"board_id":5354,"board_title":"GRB Subject Notes","board_description":"Have questions about a GRB subject?

I acknowledge that exports can take some time to prepare -- that's typically due to a backup in the processing queue rather than it taking an extremely long time for your individual export to be created. However, please do tell me if download is taking a long time -- that would be unexpected.\n\nI recommend that you consider using workflow-specific classification exports.  These will break up the full project-wide classification file (currently 0.5 GB) into a few individual files. You can request these files via the [data export page](https://www.zooniverse.org/lab/18664/data-exports) or via the Python Client.\n","comment_focus_id":null,"comment_focus_type":null,"comment_user_id":63325,"comment_user_login":"lcjohnso","comment_created_at":"2024-04-12T21:09:36.952Z"},{"board_id":5354,"board_title":"GRB Subject Notes","board_description":"Have questions about a GRB subject?
